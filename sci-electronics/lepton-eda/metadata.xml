		The GPL Electronic Design Automation (gEDA) project has produced and
		continues working on a full GPL'd suite and toolkit of Electronic
		Design Automation tools. These tools are used for electrical circuit
		design, schematic capture, simulation, prototyping, and
		production. Currently, the gEDA project offers a mature suite of free
		software applications for electronics design, including schematic
		capture, attribute management, bill of materials (BOM) generation,
		netlisting into over 20 netlist formats, analog and digital
		simulation, and printed circuit board (PCB) layout.
		The lepton-eda (this package) provides a fork of gschem,
		the schematic capture of gEDA.
